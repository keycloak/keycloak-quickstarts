# <span>Keycloak</span> Quickstarts

<span>Keycloak</span> is an Open Source Identity and Access Management solution for modern Applications and Services.

The quickstarts herein provided demonstrate securing applications with <span>Keycloak</span> using different programming languages (and frameworks) 
and how to extend the server capabilities through a set of Java-based [Service Provider Interfaces(SPI)](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/). 
They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.

They are organized in this repository under different categories (or directories) as follows:

| Category  | Description                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| extension | Examples about how to extend the server capabilities using some of the Keycloak SPIs. |
| jakarta   | Examples about how to secure Jakarta Applications                                        |
| js        | Examples about how to secure JavaScript Applications                                  |
| nodejs    | Examples about how to secure NodeJS Applications                                      |
| spring    | Examples about how to secure Spring Applications                                      |

For any missing programming language and framework, you might want to consider looking at:

  * [Securing a Resource Server Application](https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-bearer-token-authentication-tutorial)

We are happy to accept contributions for any reference that demonstrates how to
integrate Keycloak with additional programming languages or frameworks.

## Building, Testing, and Running the Quickstarts

First clone the Keycloak repository:

    git clone https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts.git
    cd keycloak-quickstarts

Each quickstart provides its own documentation with the steps you need to follow in order to build, test, and run the example.
Look at the `README.md` file at the root of a quickstart for more details.

### Chrome driver version

Some automated tests rely on the chrome browser present on your laptop. Also you need to have correct version of chrome driver according
to the version of the chrome browser used. In case of the issues, see [Chrome page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/) and download
correct chrome driver version for your Chrome browser. Then add system property `webdriver.chrome.driver` when running the tests according to chrome version
and add whole path to the chrome driver. For instance something like `-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/somedir/chromedriver-linux64-119.0.6045.105/chromedriver`.
